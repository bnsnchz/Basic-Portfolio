        <p class="bio">My name is Ben Sanchez, I'm currently attending the coding bootcamp at UCLA to train to be a web developer and further my career and achieve better financial stability. Before atending the bootcamp I worked as a photorapher and also played music in a few bands. I am a trumpet player and a drummer. I've been playing music for over 20 years now and have performed at Disney Concert Hall twice.
