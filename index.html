    <p>My name is Benjamin Sanchez, I'm currently attending the coding bootcamp at UCLA to train to be a web developer and further my career and achieve better financial stability.</p>

    <p>Before atending the bootcamp I worked as a photorapher and also played music in a few bands. I am a trumpet player and a drummer. I've been playing music for over 20 years now and have performed at Disney Concert Hall twice. </p>
